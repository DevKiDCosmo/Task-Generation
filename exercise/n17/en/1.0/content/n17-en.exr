A quantum field theory model is given to describe the interference of two moving wave packets in a scalar field. Develop a complete theoretical and numerical model that describes and analyzes the construction, evolution, and interference of the wave packets within quantum field theory.

Complete the following subtasks:

1. **Theoretical Foundations**
- Explain the quantization of a free scalar field.
- Derive the field operator \( \hat{\phi}(x, t) \).
- Describe the commutator behavior of \( \hat{a}_k \), \( \hat{a}^\dagger_k \).

2. **Construction of the Wave Packet States**
- Define two orthogonal Gaussian momentum distributions \( f_1(k) \), \( f_2(k) \). - Derive the state
\[
|\Psi\rangle = \left(\int f_1(k) \hat{a}_k^\dagger\, dk + \int f_2(k) \hat{a}_k^\dagger\, dk \right)|0\rangle
\]
and normalize it.

3. **Expectation Value and Interference**
- Calculate the expectation value \( \langle \Psi|\hat{\phi}(x,t)|\Psi\rangle \).
- Identify cross terms and their contribution to the interference.
- Visualize the interference pattern as a function of \(x \), \(t \), \(\delta \).

4. **Time Evolution and Wave Packet Propagation**
- Simulate the propagation of the wave packets in space and time.
- Analyze the influence of group and phase velocities on the interference structure.
- Discuss any dispersion phenomena that may occur.

5. **Extension to field operator products**
- Calculate the two-point function \( \langle \Psi|\hat{\phi}(x,t)\hat{\phi}(x',t)|\Psi\rangle \).
- Analyze its space-time structure.
- Discuss implications for possible measurements.

6. **Experimental Interpretation and Model Validation**
- Compare your model with a quantum optical interferometer (e.g., Mach-Zehnder).
- Discuss measurement operators, state collapse, and interference visibility.

7. **Reflection, Complexity Analysis, and Model Limits**
- Estimate the algorithmic complexity of your numerical methods.
- Discuss possible extensions (e.g., spinor fields, QED).
- Reflect on the validity and limitations of scalar field theory.

The paper should be mathematically sound, physically interpreted, and supplemented by numerical simulations.
