Given a point set $P \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ with $|P| = kn$ for some $k \in \mathbb{N}_{\geq 2}$, where the points are in general position (i.e., no $n+1$ points lie in an $(n-1)$-dimensional hyperplane).

A rotation traversal process works as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item Choose a starting point $p_0 \in P$.

\item Construct an $(n-1)$-hypersurface (a "surface of revolution") through this point.

\item This hypersurface is continuously rotated in a fixed manner (e.g., according to a fixed orientation in space).

\item As soon as another point $p_i \in P$ is "touched" by the surface (i.e., is located on the surface), $p_i$ becomes the new anchor point.

\item The movement continues from there.

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Extension}

\begin{itemize}

\item Between each rotation, the orientation of the surface is changed using a given matrix of $SO(n)$ (i.e., each rotation is specified by a transition operator).

\item Interpoint relationships are stored as a directed graph $G = (V, E)$, where a directed transition $p_i \to p_j$ exists if $p_j$ was reached by a feasible rotation of $p_i$.

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Exercises}

\begin{enumerate}

\item Prove or disprove: For certain point configurations (e.g., regular grids, random point clouds, points on spheres, or simplicial surfaces), the reachability graph is strongly connected.

\item Find a general algorithm that, for any $n$ and point set $P$, decides whether complete reachability of all points is possible through the process.

\item Investigate: How does reachability change when transition delays or random perturbations are introduced into the rotation?

\item Formulate an optimization: Find a minimal rotation path through all points that respects the transition rules.

\item Design a visualization (in 2D, 3D, or nD projections) that dynamically shows the process and graph.
\end{enumerate}
