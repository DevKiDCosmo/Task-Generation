Given is a circle with center $O$ and radius $r=10$. A point $P$ lies outside the circle and is at a distance of $OP=17$. Determine the length of the tangent from $P$ to the circle and explain the calculation using the Pythagorean theorem.
Discuss why the length of the tangent depends only on the difference between the distances between the point and the center and the radius of the circle.
