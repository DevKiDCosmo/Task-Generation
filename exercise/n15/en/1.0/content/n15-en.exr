A recursive definition is given:

\[
P_n(x) = a_1(x)P_{n-1}(x) + a_2(x)P_{n-2}(x) + \dots + a_k(x)P_{n-k}(x),
\]

with initial values $P_0(x), \dots, P_{k-1}(x)$ and $a_i(x) \in \mathbb{Q}[x]$

Analyze:

- Conditions for closed form
- Structure of the zeros
- Connection with classical polynomials (e.g., Chebyshev, Legendre, Hermite polynomials)

# Solution structure (General steps)

### 1. **Analysis of the recursion**

- Determine the degree of recursion $k$
- Classify the coefficients $a_i(x)$
- Constant? Linear? General polynomial?

### 2. **Characteristic polynomial**

- Introduce a transformation analogous to linear recursion:
- Consider linear independence of the basis $P_0, \dots, P_k$
- Find a solution using a characteristic polynomial (for constant $a_i$)

### 3. **Representation using matrix methods**

- Write the recursion as a matrix system:

\[
\mathbf{P}_n = A(x) \mathbf{P}_{n-1},
\]

with vector $\mathbf{P}_n = [P_n, P_{n-1}, ..., P_{n-k+1}]^T$

- Examine the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of $A(x)$

### 4. **Comparison with known families**

- Check whether the polynomial belongs to a known class (orthogonal, symmetric, etc.).

### 5. **Root Structure**

- Use numerical methods to analyze the roots
- Investigate convergence behavior (e.g., for $n \to \infty$)

### 6. **Symbolic Solution (if possible)**

- Search for closed forms (e.g., using generating functions, transforming into differential equations)
- Find explicit representations using basis functions or combinatorial structures
