Prove that for every natural number $n$ the sum of the first $n$ odd numbers is equal to $n^2$. $$ 1 + 3 + 5+ \dots + (2n-1) = n^2 $$
Or also: $$ \sum^{n}_{k = 1} = (2k - 1) = n^2 = n^2 \vert n \in \mathbb{N} $$

Hint:
\begin{itemize}
\item Induction base: Show that the statement is true for $n=1$.
\item Induction step: Show that if the statement is true for an arbitrary $n$, then it is also true for $n+1$.
\end{itemize}
