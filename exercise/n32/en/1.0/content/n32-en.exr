Let \( R \) be a commutative Noetherian ring with unity \( 1 \neq 0 \), let \( M \) be a finitely generated \( R \)-module, and consider the exact sequence:

\[
0 \to N \xrightarrow{f} P \xrightarrow{g} M \to 0
\]

where \( P \) is a projective \( R \)-module.

### Problem:

1. **Cohomological Interpretation:**
Show that:
\[
\operatorname{Ext}^1_R(M, R) \cong \operatorname{Hom}_R(N, R) / f^*(\operatorname{Hom}_R(P, R))
\]

2. **Functoriality of Dualization:**
Show that the dualization by the Hom-functor \( (-)^* := \operatorname{Hom}_R(-, R) \) has a **contravariant functorial structure**.

3. **Characterization of Projectivity:**
Prove or disprove the following statement:

> If \( R \) is a local ring and \( M \) a finitely generated \( R \)-module, then:
\[
M \text{ is projective } \Longleftrightarrow \operatorname{Ext}^1_R(M, R) = 0
\]

4. **Additional Question â€“ Derived Functors:**
Define the **derived functors** of \( \operatorname{Hom}_R(-, R) \) in the sense of category theory using a projective resolution of \( M \), and explain their significance in the context of:
   - Self-dualization of modules,
   - Cohomology in module theory and representation theory.

### Notes:

- Use a **projective resolution** of \( M \) to compute \( \operatorname{Ext} \).
- Note that \( \operatorname{Hom}_R(-, R) \) is **contravariant**, i.e., it reverses the direction of morphisms.
- If needed, use the **Hom-Tensor adjunction** and known results about projective modules.
- For the additional question: explicitly give the connection between a projective resolution and the construction of \( \operatorname{Ext} \).
