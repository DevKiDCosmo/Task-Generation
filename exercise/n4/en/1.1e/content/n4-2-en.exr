 Given a set of $2n$ randomly distributed points in general position in $\mathbb{R}^n$, where:
\begin{itemize}
\item  $2n$ random points in general position in $\mathbb{R}^n$,
\item point sets $A$ and $B$ with $|A| = n+1$, $|B| = n-1$, $A \cap B = \emptyset$.
\end{itemize}
The windmill process proceeds exactly as described:
\begin{itemize}
\item Rotation around a point until a point from the respective other group is touched,
\item then change of the pivot point and continuation with a new hyper-surface.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{New rule}
each point from $P$ may be used as a pivot point at most once - if a corresponding sequence exists.
\subsubsection{Goal}
Show that a windmill sequence exists in which each point is a pivot point exactly once, while valid group changes occur and the movement is executed correctly in space.

Requirements for proving: Prove the task up to $n \le 5$.
