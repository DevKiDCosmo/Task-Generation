      "A \\textbf{windmill process} starts at an arbitrary point from $P$ (i.e., from $A$ or $B$) with an $(n-1)$-dimensional hyper-surface (\"wing\") through this point. This hyper-surface rotates continuously in the space clockwise (i.e., according to a fixed orientation in the space) until it touches exactly one other point.",

      "If a point from the other group (i.e., from $A$ if the current pivot point is in $B$, or vice versa) is hit, this point becomes the new pivot point, and the windmill process continues there with a new $(n-1)$-hyper-surface.",
