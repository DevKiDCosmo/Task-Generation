      "Given: Three points $A_1, A_2, A_3$ form an equilateral windmill in $\\mathbb{R}^2$, where the center $M$ of the equilateral triangle is also given. A point $P$ lies outside the windmill.",

      "Determine the reflection of point $P$ on the line passing through two windmill points (e.g., $A_1$ and $A_2$). Then calculate the distance between $P$ and its reflection. Show that this distance is minimal when the line passes through the center $M$ and is orthogonal to the vector $\\vec{MP}$.",
