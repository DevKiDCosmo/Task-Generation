\section{Exercises and Informtion}

The use of aids such as calculators, formula collections, spreadsheets, and digital tools is permitted only under the expressly stated conditions. Permitted aids must be declared in advance for exams and approved by the exam administrator. Any unauthorized aids are prohibited and may result in disqualification. While working on an assignment or exam, it is prohibited to obtain additional materials or external assistance unless expressly permitted. Compliance with these regulations ensures that all participants work under fair and equal conditions.

Violation of these regulations can result in serious consequences. Especially in official assessments, the use of unauthorized aids can lead to immediate exclusion from the exam. In repeated or particularly serious cases, a permanent ban from the exam may even be imposed. Compliance with these regulations ensures that all participants work under fair and equal conditions and that the integrity of the assessments is maintained.
